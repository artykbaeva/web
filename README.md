# Travel website
Our team has developed a website that allows the user to find the best options to improve their traveling experience. The website was designed to make the planning of future trips as easy and enjoyable as possible. The website's functionality includes searching for stays, activities, and food in any part of the world. Since the travel restrictions due to Covid-19, the website offers a movie selection to watch and reminisce or to get inspiration for future travels. https://www.figma.com/file/6iAVUa2Pd0seUnhnIV0Ds9/travel?node-id=0%3A1
